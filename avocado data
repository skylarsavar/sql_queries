# Goal is to find out the total number of bags of avocados sold on each date at each location using this data.

#1. What percent of the total number of bags were small bags. Finding this might help stakeholders make decisions on how to package avocados or which size bag to run a sale on. 
SELECT 
  Date,
  Region,
  Total_Bags,
  Small_Bags,
  (Small_Bags / Total_Bags)* 100 as Small_Bags_Percent
FROM `zeta-time-396120.Avocado_data.Avocado_prices` 
WHERE 
  Total_Bags <> 0

#2. Find the total revenue for all bags sold
SELECT sum(averageprice * total_bags) as total_revenue
FROM `zeta-time-396120.Avocado_data.Avocado_prices` 

#3. Find the total number of avocados sold
SELECT sum(total_volume)
FROM `zeta-time-396120.Avocado_data.Avocado_prices`
