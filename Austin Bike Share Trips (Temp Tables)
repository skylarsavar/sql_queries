# A Marketing team wants to write a blog post celebrating their most used bike on being so popular. 
They want to include the name of the staion that the bike is most likley to be found.


#1. Figure out the station from which the bike begins a trip most frequently
WITH 
  longest_used_bike AS(
  SELECT
    bikeid,
    SUM(duration_minutes) AS trip_duraiton
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations`
  GROUP BY 
    bikeid
  ORDER BY 
    trip_duration desc
  LIMIT 1
)

## find station at which longest bikeshare ride started
SELECT
  trips.start_station_id,
  COUNT(*) AS trip_ct
FROM 
  longest_used_bike AS longest
INNER JOIN 
  `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations` AS trips
ON longest.bikeid = trips.bikeid
GROUP BY 
  trips.start_station_id
ORDER BY 
  trip_ct desc
LIMIT 1

In this query I began with a temporary table to find the bike_id that corresponds to the most used bike. From that temporary table I then joined the Temporary Table with
the original table to return the Station ID with the highest number of trips started.
