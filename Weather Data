# In this SQL, I'm querying a database with Weather data for the entire US. I will create a subset of the data in a separate table to answer questions for a local news station

#1. Get the temperature, wind speed, and precipitation for station La Guardia and JFK, for everyday in 2020, in descending order by date, and ascending order by Station ID
SELECT
  stn,
  date,
IF(
    temp = 9999.9,
    NULL,
    temp) AS temperature,
IF(
    wdsp = "999.9",
    NULL,
    CAST(wdsp AS Float64)) AS wind_speed,
IF(
    prcp = 99.99,
    0,
    prcp) AS precipitation 
FROM 
  bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod_gsod2020
WHERE
  stn = "725030" -- La Guardia
OR stn = "744860" -- JFK
ORDERY BY 
  date desc,
  stn asc

#2. Find the avergae temperature in June 2020 
SELECT 
  AVG(temperature)
FROM `idyllic-analyst-397320.demos.nye_weather` 
WHERE 
  date BETWEEN '2020-06-01' AND '2020-06-30'

#3. Find the average wind_speed in December 2020
SELECT 
  AVG(wind_speed)
FROM `idyllic-analyst-397320.demos.nye_weather` 
WHERE
